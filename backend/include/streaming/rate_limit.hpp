/// UploadRateLimiter — two-pool upload bandwidth coordinator.
///
/// Production wiring of the algorithm validated in
/// tests/rate_limit_two_pool.cc (8 rounds, all checks green; design doc
/// docs/tmp-streaming-research/two-pool-bandwidth-allocation.md).
///
/// Model:
///   - Streams are classified ONCE at join (pure function of Content-Length):
///       length >= classify_mb  → limited pool
///       length <  classify_mb  → normal pool (latency priority)
///       length unknown         → limited pool (from byte 0 — a client
///                                 streaming without a declared length is the
///                                 agent-big-request signature)
///   - Every limited flow carries a cap from its FIRST byte (cap = P initially,
///     keeping curl's MAX_SEND_SPEED window warm — a cap applied mid-flight
///     stalls 6.5–10.9 s because curl anchors the window at transfer start).
///   - Every 200 ms tick (driven by the stream owner thread's event loop):
///       backlog = Σ normal flows (Content-Length − uploaded)   // measured
///       claim   = min(backlog / 1 s, P)
///       budget  = clamp(P − claim − 5%·P, 10%·P, P − 5%·P)
///       target  = max(budget / N_limited, 32 KB/s)
///     Down-scaling cuts at most 2× per tick and never cuts a flow that made
///     no progress last tick (consecutive halvings chain into one long
///     stall — measured 8.4 s).
///   - Upstream sockets are bounded via SO_SNDBUF = 64 KB (see
///     curl_multi_pool setup) — without it `uploaded` (CURLINFO_SIZE_UPLOAD_T)
///     leads the wire by MBs and the backlog signal is blind.
///
/// Threading: each stream is driven by ONE thread (the pump-pool thread that
/// owns its curl_multi).  The owner calls tick() from its pump loop; the
/// coordinator's mutex serialises the (cheap) bookkeeping.  CURLOPT cap
/// writes happen only in tick()/join()/finish() — i.e. on the owner thread —
/// which keeps easy-handle access thread-affine.
