/// CurlMultiPool — per-thread libcurl multi-handle HTTP client.
///
/// Replaces internal httplib::Client usage for upstream proxying.
/// - One CURLM* per instance, intended for single-thread use.
/// - Streaming (execute_stream) drives the transfer on the CALLING thread's
///   multi handle — no per-stream worker thread, no per-stream curl_multi.
///   Connection reuse therefore works: the multi handle caches upstream
///   connections across the streams it processes.
/// - Forced HTTP/2 (CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2) to avoid h3 negotiation.
/// - Four-segment timeout: connect, upload-stall (LOW_SPEED), response-header
///   wait, inter-event idle (enforced by the caller via stream_read's timeout).
/// - Sliding-window upload via CURLOPT_READFUNCTION + BodySource with
///   CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE backpressure.
